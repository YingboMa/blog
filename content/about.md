## A few things about me

- I am interested in researching new algorithms and writing fast software
  implementations to accelerate numerical integration for [stiff ordinary
  differential equations](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Stiff_system) and
  [differential-algebraic
  equations](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Differential-algebraic_equations).
  These equations are an integral part of modeling for mechanical, chemical, and
  biological systems.
- I like reading fantasy novels during my leisure time.
- I am working on my sleep schedule.

## A few of my projects

- [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl). A collection
  of algorithms for solving ordinary differential equations and
  differential-algebraic equations.
- [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl). A modeling
  framework for automatically parallelized scientific computing.
- [DiffEqFlux.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl). A package for neural
  differential equations.
- [DiffEqSensitivity.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqSensitivity.jl). A
  package for doing sensitivity analysis.
- [Assorted packages](https://github.com/YingboMa)
